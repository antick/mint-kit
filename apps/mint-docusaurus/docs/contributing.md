and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project. Contributors and people new to open
source will find the following guides especially useful:

## Get Involved

There are many ways to contribute to Mint Stacks, and some of them don't involve writing any code. Here are a few 
ideas to get started:

1. Just start using one of the boilerplate from the Mint Stack. Does everything work as expected? If not, we're always
   looking for improvements. Let us know by opening an issue.
2. Read through the docs and if you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, feel free to make edits by 
   clicking "Edit" at the bottom of the doc page.
3. Help us by either suggesting solutions for the opened bugs or by directly working on them and raising the Pull Requests.
4. Take a look at the features requested by others and consider opening a pull request if you see something you want
   to work on.

### Join our Discord Server

You can also contribute in our Discord Community Server by helping other people with their problems. Or you can hang
around to chat and make new dev friends.

## Our Development Process

We only use master/main as our primary branch and all the pull requests should be raised for this branch only.

### Bugs

We use GitHub Issues to keep track of our bugs. If you would like to report any problem, take a look around and see if
someone already opened an issue about it. If you are certain this is a new unreported bug, you can submit a bug report.

### Pull Requests

Make sure your PR only solves one problem (issue), otherwise please split it up in multiple PR's for a better
overview.

Please make sure the following is done before submitting a new pull request:

1. Fork the respective boilerplate repository and create your branch from master/main.
2. Make sure your code is formatted properly using prettier and ESLint.
3. Make sure all your tests pass.
4. Make sure the fix/implementation you submit is tested properly.

All pull requests should be opened against the master/main branch and should have a related issue for the same.

### License

By contributing to any of the boilerplate in Mint Stack, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under 
its MIT license.
