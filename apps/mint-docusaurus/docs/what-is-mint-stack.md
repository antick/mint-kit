Mint Stack is a collection of different boilerplates/starter-kits. Right now we have MERN stack available which is
configured to use the best coding standards and practices along with some out of the box functionalities.

Currently, I am trying my best to release the first release (v0.1.0) as I am the only one working on it right now in my
free time.

## Features

We have following features in-built with all of our stacks.

1. Authentication and authorization
2. Centralized error handling
3. Robust modular architecture
4. Unit, integration and end-to-end testing with coverage reports
5. Docker support
6. Code linting
7. In-built pages: Login, Signup, Forgot password, User profile, Dashboard etc.
